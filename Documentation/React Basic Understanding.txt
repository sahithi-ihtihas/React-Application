React Version-16

Node JS helps to cook js for server
it is for your building process

-Developed by facebook - old 2008 fb if you need to update a story u need to refresh 
  react JS helps things happening in sync/ parallel

-  MVC - Model view controller can  be used on server side
      It is more of design pattern can be used with any language

- SPA - for ui, for developer- desktop, mobile applications can be controlled by single framework
JSP becomes difficult to bind businees logic to get dynamic data

React gives dynamic data - both ui and server can work independently

Drawback of traditional - DOM (which needs to be refreshed continously), memory waste and slow 
This is react overcomes

(traditional es6 classes) Component centric Development (like templates) - JSX javascript extension
Changes made anywhere doesnt required refresh of whole page

-ReactJSVirtual DOM - copy of view is kept in memory any changes made that is only refreshed 
-Serverside rendering
-Data binding


Angular is MVC
But react is only View

Angular is a Framework. React is a library

Angular is 2 data binding
React 1 way data binding i.e. only 1 store - it is as good as 2 -way it will never loose data

================================================================================
createreact app contains webpack which has internal task manager which listen to changes by default


import React etc are default loaded from node modules installed

Class - Capital Letter

Render() - predefined function- when u are here.this is it return something and that is JSX
It has only one div otherwise it gives error JSX expressions have only one Parent class

ReactDOM - Tells how to render
reactdom.render contains 2 things what to render, where to render

Use component <name/> in parent

props are mutable (profile pic cant be changed by frnds)
states are immutable (likes that can be changed)


state is sent by parent, prop is what received by child

State- intialise, change state, render

if u try to change the state or prop then u have to bind that

preState gives current state

stateless components where there will no reflections of change of components they are just presentation components

in stateless there are no extended classes and no render function

=================================================================================
Multiple page applications bandwith is waste on server side

switch helps u to pick routes and redirect
==========================================================
sass - extension of css
 - u can reuse it, compute it 
- it cannot be understood by browsers
-Syntactically awesome style sheet
==================================================================

Redux - predictable state container for js apps
- it can used for any react,jquery etc
-independent api

store is a universal container thAT CONTAINS states. Global provider

state is a immutable - in case changed it actually doesnt change it gives new state
changes are made with pure functions
reducers have actions and states
actions are responsinble to change state

redux has provider

react children has connect to take the state from redux
connect is who is providing the state and component who needs the state
